Python scripts for generating nanogels and performing Langevin dynamics and dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations with Espresso

Nanogel Simulations

This repository contains Python scripts for generating nanogels and performing Langevin dynamics and dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations using ESPResSo. It includes all necessary files, such as "id_type_pos.dat" and "id_bond_ids.dat," to set up and run simulations, and saves the trajectory and analysis results.
